The solution involves understanding the CSS Specificity rules.

Instead of trying to increase specificity using `.container #specific-div`, it's better to directly target the element using its ID:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

#specific-div {
  color: green; 
}

/* No need for this rule, the #specific-div rule is sufficient */
/* .container #specific-div {
  color: purple; 
} */
```

Alternatively, if you need to target an element with both a class and ID, ensure the specificity is applied correctly.  If you really want to apply the purple color, you need to ensure the selector has higher specificity (e.g., using `!important` but its usage should be avoided unless extremely necessary).

The key takeaway is to avoid creating unnecessary CSS rules and ensure that your selectors are explicitly targeting the elements you intend to style.  Understanding CSS specificity is crucial for predictable styling.
