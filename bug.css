The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and the cascade:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red; /* This rule is intended to override the div rule */
}

#specific-div {
  color: green; /* This rule should override the previous two */
}

.container #specific-div { /* Incorrectly trying to increase specificity */
  color: purple; /* This rule will NOT override #specific-div due to specificity rules */
}
```

The unexpected behavior is that the `#specific-div` rule's `color: green` is not overridden by `.container #specific-div`'s `color: purple`. Although the second rule appears more specific, the `id` selector in `#specific-div` has higher specificity than a combination of class and ID selectors. This showcases a misunderstanding of how CSS specificity works, especially when dealing with combinations of class and ID selectors.
